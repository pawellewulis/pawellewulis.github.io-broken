The unbiased variance estimator is given by the well-known formula:

$$
\widehat{\sigma}^2 := \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( X_i - \overline{X} \right)^2 ,
$$

where $X_1,\dots,X_n$ are independent draws from the same distribution and $\overline{X}$ denotes the sample mean.

Every so often, someone in the room eventually asks:

<div class="aside" markdown="1">
*Why do we have $n-1$ in the denominator? The expression looks almost like an average of $n$ squared deviations, so why isn't the denominator simply $n$?*
</div>

There are two answers one usually hears:

1. Write down the bias $\mathbf{E}[\widehat{\sigma}^2] - \sigma^2$, expand the square, expand $\overline{X}$, expand all the sums, calculate. See? It’s $0$.
2. Because there are only $n-1$ degrees of freedom among the $X_i$, since translating all measurements by the same amount leaves the variance unchanged.

The first answer is formally correct, but it explains little. The second one may feel hand-wavy. Why should degrees of freedom matter at all? Where, exactly, did the missing dimension go?

Since the difference between $\frac{1}{n}$ and $\frac{1}{n-1}$ is most visible for small values of $n$, let us begin by examining what happens in that regime.


### Some Intuition: Case $n = 1$

Suppose we have only a single random measurement, and we observe $X_1 = 10$.  
There are many pairs $(\mu,\sigma)$ consistent with such an observation, for example:

1. $\mu \approx 10$ and $\sigma$ very small,
2. $\mu \approx 10$ and $\sigma \approx 50$.

There is no way to decide which scenario is closer to the truth. The scale of $\sigma$ can vary by orders of magnitude while remaining compatible with the data. A single observation provides no reliable information about the variance, so an unbiased estimator of $\sigma^2$ cannot exist in this setting.

Now suppose $\mu = 15$ is known and we observe $X_1 = 10$. While we still cannot estimate $\sigma$ precisely, we at least gain information about its order of magnitude. For instance, it is unlikely that $\sigma \ll 1$. This is weak information, but it is no longer nothing.

When the exact value of the mean is known, we are granted a point of reference. For fixed $\mu$, we can construct a slightly different unbiased estimator:

$$
\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu\text{ known}} := \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \left( X_i - \mu \right)^2
$$

As we can see, the $-1$ disappears from the denominator. To summarize:

- For $n = 1$, it makes sense that the variance cannot be estimated unless $\mu$ is known.
- Replacing $n$ with $n - 1$ in the denominator can be viewed as a premium paid for not knowing the exact value of $\mu$.

The second point may seem vague for now. In the following sections, we make this intuition more precise.


### Orthogonal Projections

When thinking about $\widehat{\sigma}^2$ geometrically, we may view it as the squared Euclidean norm of an $n$-dimensional vector, normalized by $n-1$. If we define the sample vector

$$
\boldsymbol{X} = [X_1, \dots, X_n]^\top
$$

and the center-of-mass vector

$$
\boldsymbol{C} = \overline{X}\,\mathbf{1}
= [\overline{X}, \dots, \overline{X}]^\top,
$$

where $\mathbf{1}$ stands for the all-ones vector, then

$$
\widehat{\sigma}^2
= \frac{1}{n-1}\,\lVert \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{C} \rVert_{\ell^2}^2.
$$

Here $\lVert \cdot \rVert_{\ell^2}$ denotes the Euclidean norm, the standard way mathematicians refer to “distance from zero”.

Neat. We are interested in the expected distance from $\boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{C}$ to $\mathbf{0}$. Let us notice a simple but important property of this vector. If we define $X_i' = X_i - \overline{X}$ for $i = 1, \dots, n$, then

$$
\langle \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{C}, \mathbf{1} \rangle
= X_1' + \dots + X_n'=
$$

$$
\left( X_1 - \frac{X_1 + \dots + X_n}{n} \right)
+ \dots
+ \left( X_n - \frac{X_1 + \dots + X_n}{n} \right)
= 0.
$$

This shows that the random vectors $\boldsymbol{X}-\boldsymbol{C}$ are perpendicular to the all-ones vector $\mathbf{1}$. Since $\boldsymbol{C}$ itself is a scalar multiple of $\mathbf{1}$, it follows that $\boldsymbol{X}-\boldsymbol{C}$ is the orthogonal projection of $\boldsymbol{X}$ onto the hyperplane

$$
x_1 + \dots + x_n = 0.
$$

Let us take a look at a simple case in dimension two.

Even though the scenario depicted above may appear overly simplistic, it still allows for a few useful observations.

- If $\mu = 0$, the squared distance of the blue point from the origin represents $n\,\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu\text{ known}}$. Changing $\mu$ simply translates the point along the $[1,1]^\top$ direction, while its projection remains fixed.
- Similarly, the squared distance of the red point from the origin represents $(n-1)\,\widehat{\sigma}^2$, where we pretend that the true value of $\mu$ remains unknown.

Basic trigonometry shows that we have

$$
\lVert \boldsymbol{X} \rVert_{\ell^2} \cos(\alpha)
=
\lVert \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{C} \rVert_{\ell^2},
$$

which in the $\mu = 0$ case implies

$$
n\,\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu\text{ known}} \cos(\alpha)

= (n-1)\,\widehat{\sigma}^2 .
$$

Now observe that replacing $n-1$ with $n$ in the definition of $\widehat{\sigma}^2$ would lead to a highly dubious identity

$$
\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu\text{ known}} \cos(\alpha)
\stackrel{?!}{=}
\widehat{\sigma}^2.
$$

Since $\lvert \cos(\alpha) \rvert \leq 1$, this would systematically push the variance estimate downward. This is precisely the bias we want to avoid.

While this is not yet a proof, it is already clear that using $\frac{1}{n}$ is a wrong choice of the normalization factor when constructing $\widehat{\sigma}^2$.




## More Intuition: Case $n = 2$

In this experiment we sample $\mu$ from the interval $[-3, 3]$.
For this mean we draw $(X_1, X_2)$ pairs $500$ times, where
$X_1$ and $X_2$ come from the normal distribution $\mathcal{N}(\mu, 1)$.
For each pair, we estimate the variance by computing both
$\widehat{\sigma}^2$ and $\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu \text{ known}}$.

We proceed in the same way as in the previous subsection:

- To obtain $\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu \text{ known}}$, we compute the distance
  from $(X_1, X_2)$ to $(\mu, \mu)$.
- To obtain $\widehat{\sigma}^2$, we compute the distance from the origin to the
  projection of $(X_1, X_2)$ onto the line $X_1 + X_2 = 0$.

<img src="/assets/mu_shift_2.gif"
     alt="Variance estimator animation"
     style="max-width: 600px; width: 100%; display: block; margin: 1.5em auto;">

As the animation shows, both estimators remain constant as $\mu$ varies.
This is expected: $\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu \text{ known}}$ is proportional to
the distance from the center of the blue mass, so translating it changes nothing,
while $\widehat{\sigma}^2$ is based on projections, and translating the blue mass
along the $[1,1]^\top$ direction does not affect its projection.

We observe that the deviation of the red dots is systematically smaller, since one
direction is removed entirely. This is precisely the geometric origin of the
$n - 1$ degrees of freedom.

What is the main source of this discrepancy? Consider a blue point
$\boldsymbol{X} = (4.01, 4.03)$ under $\mu = 2$. Being far from the center of the
blue mass, it contributes substantially to the average deviation. After
projection, however, the situation looks different. The same point is mapped to
$\boldsymbol{P}(\boldsymbol{X}) = (-0.01, 0.01)$, which lies very close to
$\mathbf{0}$.

This reflects the fact that observing $X_1 = 4.01$ and $X_2 = 4.03$ with $\mu$
unknown naturally suggests values concentrated around $4$ and a small variance.
While $n = 2$ hardly constitutes a meaningful sample, this interpretation is at
least reasonable if one is forced to make a judgement.

To observe a similar effect for larger samples (namely, all measurements clustering
together while remaining far from the true mean) we would need to be rather unlucky.
This explains why replacing $\frac{1}{n}$ with $\frac{1}{n-1}$ becomes almost
irrelevant for large $n$, but crucial when the sample is small.




### Geometric Argument, Made Formal

Let's play around a bit with the expression

$$
\widehat{\theta} := \sum_{i=1}^n 
\left( X_i - \overline{X} \right)^2 ,
$$

As we have already seen, the sum looks like an $\ell^2$ norm of something. To make this precise, let's re-introduce the following notation:

$$
\text{the sample vector}\quad
\boldsymbol{X} =
\begin{bmatrix}
X_{1} \\
\vdots \\
X_{n}
\end{bmatrix},
\qquad
\text{the all-ones vector}\quad
\boldsymbol{1} =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 \\
\vdots \\
1
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

We can then form the vector $\boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1}\overline{X}$, noting that $\overline{X}$ is just a scalar:

$$
\boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X} 
=
\begin{bmatrix}
X_{1} - \overline{X}  \\
\vdots \\
X_{n} - \overline{X} 
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

We can now see that $\widehat{\theta}$ is obtained by summing the squares of the entries of the vector above. That gives us

$$
\widehat{\theta}
=
\| \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X} \|_{\ell^2}^2.
$$

This observation also allows us to rewrite $\widehat{\theta}$ in a more compact way, more suitable for matrix calculations:

$$
\widehat{\theta}
=
\langle \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X},
\boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X} \rangle
=
\left( \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X} \right)^\top
\left( \boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X} \right).
$$

We notice that the expression $\boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X}$ is meaningful in some way. It would be neat to have a linear operator $\boldsymbol{P}$ that satisfies

$$
\boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X}
=
\boldsymbol{X} - \boldsymbol{1} \overline{X},
$$

so we could study its properties and hopefully get some insights. To get there, we need to describe $\overline{X}$ in terms of $\boldsymbol{X}$:

$$
\overline{X}
=
\frac{1}{n} \left( X_1 + \dots + X_n \right)
=
\frac{1}{n} \boldsymbol{1}^\top \boldsymbol{X}.
$$

Of course, the dot product above could be also described as $\boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{1}$, but we need $\boldsymbol{X}$ itself not to be transposed. Then,

$$
\boldsymbol{X} - \overline{X} \boldsymbol{1}
=
\boldsymbol{X}
-
\frac{1}{n} \boldsymbol{1} \boldsymbol{1}^\top \boldsymbol{X}
=
\underbrace{
\left( \mathbf{id} - \frac{1}{n} \boldsymbol{1}\boldsymbol{1}^\top \right)
}_{\boldsymbol{P}}
\boldsymbol{X}.
$$

Just for the record, the matrix $\boldsymbol{P}$ is:

$$
\boldsymbol{P}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & \cdots & 0 \\
0 & 1 & \cdots & 0 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}
-
\frac{1}{n}
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1 \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
1 & 1 & \cdots & 1
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
1-\frac{1}{n} & -\frac{1}{n} & \cdots & -\frac{1}{n} \\
-\frac{1}{n} & 1-\frac{1}{n} & \cdots & -\frac{1}{n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
-\frac{1}{n} & -\frac{1}{n} & \cdots & 1-\frac{1}{n}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

Fine, we succeeded in creating an operator $\boldsymbol{P}$ of the desired property. We get

$$
\widehat{\theta}
=
(\boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X})^\top (\boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X})
=
\boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{P}^\top \boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X}.
$$

The matrix/operator $\boldsymbol{P}$ has two critical properties:

1. It is symmetric, so $\boldsymbol{P}^\top = \boldsymbol{P}$.
2. It effectively subtracts the mean (or the center of mass) from a vector. Doing it twice changes nothing, because the mean has already been removed after the first pass. Hence, $\boldsymbol{P}^2 = \boldsymbol{P}$.

In other words, it's an orthogonal projection (as already observed in the previous sections). Thus, we get

$$
\widehat{\theta}
=
\boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X}.
$$

To answer what factor fits an unbiased estimator of variance, we need to calculate the expected value of the expressions above. To this end, we need a supplementary result.




<div class="lemma-box" markdown="1">

**Little Lemma.** $~$ Let $\boldsymbol{X}$ be a random vector of independent entries of length $n$ such that
$X_i \sim X$ for all the indices $i$, where $X$ is a random variable with well defined
expected value $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$. Let $\boldsymbol{A}$ be an $n \times n$
matrix. Then,

$$
\mathbf{E}\!\left[ \boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{X} \right]
=
\mu^2 \Sigma_{\boldsymbol{A}} + \sigma^2 \operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{A}),
$$

where $\Sigma_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ stands for the sum of all the entries of $\boldsymbol{A}$
and $\operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{A})$ for the trace of $\boldsymbol{A}$.

</div>

*Proof.* $~$ Unfortunately, we need to simply expand. It doesn't seem like there is anything more
clever we could pull off:

$$
\mathbf{E}\!\left[ \boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{X} \right]
=
\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij} \mathbf{E} \left[ X_i X_j \right].
$$

Provided that $i \neq j$, we have

$$
\mathbf{E} \left[ X_i X_j \right]
=
\mathbf{E} \left[ X_i \right] \mathbf{E} \left[ X_j \right]
=
\mathbf{E} \left[ X \right]^2
=
\mu^2.
$$

On the other hand, if $i=j$, then
$\mathbf{E} \left[ X_i X_j \right] = \mathbf{E} \left[ X^2 \right]$ and we notice

$$
\sigma^2
=
\mathbf{E} \left[ (X - \mu)^2 \right]
=
\mathbf{E} \left[ X^2 \right] - \mu^2,
$$

which gives $\mathbf{E} \left[ X^2 \right] = \sigma^2 + \mu^2$.

This gives us

$$
\mathbf{E}\!\left[ \boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{A} \boldsymbol{X} \right]
=
\mu^2 \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n A_{ij}
+
\sigma^2 \sum_{i=1}^n A_{ii}
=
\mu^2 \Sigma_{\boldsymbol{A}} + \sigma^2 \operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{A}).
$$

<span class="qed">□</span>


In our discussion we are interested in calculating
$\mathbf{E} \left[ \boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X} \right]$.
This turns out to be quite simple, because the sum of all the entries vanishes. We thus have

$$
\mathbf{E} [ \widehat{\theta} ]
=
\sigma^2 \operatorname{tr}(\boldsymbol{P})
=
(n-1)\sigma^2.
$$

That's all. To make the estimator unbiased, we just divide $\widehat{\theta}$ by $n-1$.




### Appendix: What if $\mu$ is known?

Let us follow the same geometric argument. First, we note that

$$
\mathbf{E}[\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\text{$\mu$ known}}]
=
\mathbf{E}[\boldsymbol{X}^2] - \mu^2.
$$

We also observe that for the sample vector $\boldsymbol{X}$ it holds that

$$
\mathbf{E}[\boldsymbol{X}^2]
=
\frac{1}{n} \| \boldsymbol{X} \|_{\ell^2}
=
\frac{1}{n} \boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{X}.
$$

In other words, we now deal with $\boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{X}$ instead of
$\boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{P} \boldsymbol{X}$. The projection matrix
$\boldsymbol{P}$ got replaced by the identity matrix $\mathbf{id}$.
Applying Little Lemma, we obtain

$$
\frac{1}{n}
\mathbf{E}\!\left[
\boldsymbol{X}^\top \boldsymbol{X}
\right]
=
\mu^2 + \sigma^2,
$$

since $\text{tr}(\mathbf{id}) = n$. This yields

$$
\mathbf{E}[\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\text{$\mu$ known}}]
=
\mu^2 + \sigma^2 - \mu^2
=
\sigma^2.
$$

The means cancel out, as they should, since the variance has nothing to do with
$\mu$. The estimator $\widehat{\sigma}^2_{\mu\ \text{known}}$ is unbiased, and the
factor $n-1$ simply does not show up here.
